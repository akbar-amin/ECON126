    "1. This denominator represents the utility for *not* working, or leisure. Therefore, the marginal utility gained from leisure is the satisfaction (numerator) gained from an additional unit of leisure, which is at the cost of doing work. \n",

    "2. This represents the marginal utility of consumption (denominator) as the change in utility if one were to consume an additional unit of goods that was worked for. \n",

    "3. An increase in TFP shifts the labor demand curve to the right (outward). Productivity has increased and therefore there is an increase in labor demand. \n",

    "4. An increase in consuption shifts the labor supply curve to the left (inward). One of the reasons for this may be a change in workers' preferences. "

    "1. Consuming 1 more unit today yields its utility for today at the cost of its utility tomorrow (saving). In other words, if you consume today, you get the marginal utlity of consumption for today. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Saving 1 more unit today yields extra units of utility in the future. The benefit the product between the numerator discounted by beta and the marginal utility of today, or the marginal product.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. An increase in TFP will initially increase all factors, but then eventually return to its steady state. This is because labor is decays and lowers the demand for capital.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. An increase in consumption today means that the marginal utility of consumption is low, therefore capital decreases in future periods sice you're saving less. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. An increase in savings means you benefit from extra utility, therefore capital increases in future periods.  "
